   single: quick start, intro

Welcome to the ascender Quick Start Guide. At the end of the Quick Start, you will have a functioning ascender application that you can use to launch more sophisticated playbooks. You can expect the Quick Start process to take less than thirty minutes.

To begin, you must install ascender and you must choose a target system where an initial playbook can be deployed (provided by ascender).

This first playbook executes simple Ansible tasks, while teaching you how to use ascender, as well as ensuring its proper setup. This can be any sort of system manageable by Ansible, as described in the `Managed nodes <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/basic_concepts.html#managed-nodes>`_ section of the Ansible documentation.
